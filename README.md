**Landing Page for Travel Website with HTML and CSS**

I recently designed a landing page for a travel website using HTML and CSS. The page is designed to showcase the beauty of different travel destinations, provide a seamless user experience, and encourage visitors to book their next trip.

I would like to extend my gratitude to Main Flow Services and Technologies Pvt. Ltd. for allowing me to work on this project and showcase my skills in designing a visually appealing and user-friendly landing page.
