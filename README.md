**Landing Page for Travel Website with HTML and CSS**

I recently designed a landing page for a travel website using HTML and CSS. The page is designed to showcase the beauty of different travel destinations, provide a seamless user experience, and encourage visitors to book their next trip.

I would like to extend my gratitude to Main Flow Services and Technologies Pvt. Ltd. for allowing me to work on this project, which allowed me to showcase my skills in designing a visually appealing and user-friendly landing page.
