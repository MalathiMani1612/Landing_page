**Landing Page for Travel Website with HTML and CSS**

I recently designed a landing page for a travel website using HTML and CSS. The page is designed to showcase the beauty of different travel destinations, provide a seamless user experience, and encourage visitors to book their next trip.
Features:
    * Responsive design: the page is optimized for various devices and screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience across different platforms.
    * Interactive elements: the page features interactive elements such as hover effects and dropdown menus, making it engaging and easy to use.
    * Visual appeal: the page is designed to be visually appealing, with stunning background images and colorful graphics.
Project Outcome:
The landing page is designed to be visually appealing, user-friendly, and effective in promoting travel bookings. The use of interactive elements and responsive design ensures that the page provides a seamless user experience across different devices and platforms.
